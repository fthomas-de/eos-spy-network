## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Package skeleton after eos-auth-monitor: hatchling, permissions
  `view_suspects`, `view_evidence` and `manage_settings`, a django-solo
  configuration, standalone test project `testauth`, `tools/translate.py`
  and `tools/glossary.py`
- Settings page: the Alliance, the standing below which a contact is
  hostile, and a searchable table of the Alliance and its Corporations to
  tick as contact sources, with aa-contacts' token, the time of its contacts
  and the counts per source
- Hostile list: every contact of a ticked source below the threshold, read
  from aa-contacts (optional, no ESI call of our own), merged across
  sources, without the Alliance itself and its Corporations
